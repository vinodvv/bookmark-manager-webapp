# Bookmark Manager Web App
A simple bookmark manager built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This web app allows users to add and remove bookmarks for their favourite websites. The bookmarks are stored in the browser's localStorage, so they persist even after the page is reloaded.

## Features
* Add Bookmark: Users can enter a website name and URL to add a new bookmark.
* Remove Bookmark: Users can remove a bookmark by clicking the delete button next to it.
* Bookmark Persistence: All bookmarks are saved in the browser's localStorage, allowing them to persist even after the browser is refreshed.

## Demo

### How It Works
1. Enter the Website Name and Website URL into the input fields.
2. Click the Add Bookmark button to save the bookmark.
3. Your bookmark will appear in a list below, with options to open it in a new tab or delete it.
4. The app will store your bookmarks locally, so even when you refresh the page, theyâ€™ll still be available.
